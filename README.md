## Why This Project? ü§î

Learning web development is an exciting journey, and this project was created with a few key objectives in mind:

1. **Hands-On Learning:** We believe that the best way to learn is by doing. This project provides you with practical exercises and real-world examples to reinforce your HTML and CSS skills.

2. **Structured Training:** Web development can sometimes feel overwhelming due to its vastness. We've broken down the training into 15 modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of web development. This structured approach makes learning more manageable.

3. **Portfolio Building:** By the end of this training, you'll have the skills to create your own website. Whether it's a personal blog, a small business site, or an online portfolio, you can apply what you've learned to build your web presence.

4. **Community and Support:** Learning is more fun when you're part of a community. We encourage you to share your progress, ask questions, and collaborate with fellow learners. Together, we can make this learning journey more enjoyable and productive.
